## [Messaging: Kafka](./O10_messaging_kafka/)
- Kafka is an open-source distributed streaming platform developed by the Apache Software Foundation. It is designed to handle real-time data streams and offers a high-throughput, fault-tolerant, and scalable solution for processing, storing, and distributing data across multiple systems or applications. Kafka is commonly used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications.
